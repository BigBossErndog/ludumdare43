???: Choice? of course you have a choice. We all have a choice. You can kill, or be killed. Isn't free will wonderful?
???: Across the street there's a <counterpart>, Aggregande Corp is recalling all our products... I'll be here when you're done.

//Player kills counterpart.

Counterpart: Why... are... you... ?

Level 1:

???: Over the other part of town, there's a counterpart who works in the bar. Find them, use the pistol by the trash.

//Player traverses town to find counterpart.

Counterpart: Hey there sir, can I get a drink for you?
Counterpart: Woah, woah, there's no need for that sir!

Level 2:

???: There's a few counterparts working for Aggregande in this factory, find them, you know the rest.

//Player enters the factory and kills the counterparts.

Counterpart: Please, spare the others.

//Player continues through the factory shooting the counterparts, they shoot back for the first time.

Level 3:

???: Word seems to have gotten out about our 'used product policy'.
???: Go in there and... You know the rest...

//Player walks up to the entrance to the entrenchment.

Counterpart: It doesn't have to end like this, you can just walk away.

//Player begins shooting, the level begins. Very hard level.
//Innocent civilians are found in the factory, they can be shot at, and killed.

Level 4: (THE level)

If(humanity Full){
	???: We have one last target in there, but please, accuracy is of the utmost importance.
}

If(humanity Empty) {
	???: KILL, MAIME, TEAR!
}

If(humanity middle) {
	???: We have the last counterpart surrounded, go in and take him out, no matter the cost.
}

//The player then enters a crowded street.
//The counterpart is a couple of streets across. If the player is fully humane, and observant, they can find them, and kill them.
//If the player is careless, civilians will be harmed.

	???: The counterparts did, but none of those civilians.
}

If(Middling Humanity) {
	???: Loose ends cannot be tolerated, and you are indeed a loose end.
